# iGarage 🚗📱
*A Kotlin Multiplatform automotive companion app*

iGarage is a Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM) project built with **Compose Multiplatform**, designed to give car enthusiasts a clean, powerful way to track their vehicles, maintenance schedules, market values, and overall vehicle health — all in one garage.

This project is structured for future **iOS support**, while the current development focuses on Android.
